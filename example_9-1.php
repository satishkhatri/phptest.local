            <h2>Welsh Rarebit</h2>
            <p class=”intro”>Welsh Rarebit is a savory dish made from melted cheese, often
                Cheddar, on toasted bread, and a variety of other ingredients such as mustard, egg, or
                bacon. Here is one take on this classic.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Lightly toast the bread:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Turn grill to medium heat.</li>
                        <li>Place bread under the grill.</li>
                        <li>When golden brown, remove the toasted bread from the grill.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Place on a baking tray, and spread with butter.</li>
                <li>Add the grated Cheddar cheese and 2 tablespoons of beer to a saucepan.
                    Place the saucepan over a medium heat, and stir the cheese continuously until it

                    212 ❘ CHAPTER 10 STYLING LISTS
                    How It Works
                    Example 10-1 shows two uses of the list-style-type property: The fi rst shows that you can suppress
                    the default bullet display so you can use unordered lists for site navigation, and the second shows that
                    you can set a different format of the number that precedes the ordered list and that a child list can have
                    a format different from that of its parent.

                    stirring.</li>
                <li>When thick and smooth, pour over each piece of toast spreading it to the
                    edges to stop the toast from burning.</li>
                <li>Place under the grill for a couple of minutes or until golden brown.</li>
