    <h2>Welsh Rarebit</h2>
    <p class="intro">Welsh Rarebit is a savory dish made from melted cheese, often
        Cheddar, on toasted bread, and a variety of other ingredients such as mustard,
        egg, or bacon. Here is one take on this classic.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Lightly toast the bread</li>
        <li>Place on a baking tray, and spread with butter.</li>
        <li>Add the grated Cheddar cheese and 2 tablespoons of beer to a saucepan.
            Place the saucepan over a medium heat, and stir the cheese continuously
            until it has melted. Add a teaspoon of wholegrain mustard and grind in
            a little pepper. Keep stirring.</li>
        <li>When thick and smooth, pour over each piece of toast spreading it to
            the edges to stop the toast from burning.</li>
        <li>Place under the grill for a couple of minutes or until golden
            brown.</li>
    </ol>
