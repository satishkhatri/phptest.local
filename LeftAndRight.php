        It would help if you were a little more descriptive in what
        you are trying to do. If you are trying to generate paged
        data, there are some options in how you do this.
        You can generate separate links
        for each page that you want to
        be able to get directly to.
        Note that the current page in the example
        is handled differently in the code and with CSS.

        If you want the paged data to be changed via
        AJAX, this is where jQuery would come in.
        What you would do is add a click handler
        to each of the anchor tags corresponding
        to a different page. This click handler
        would invoke some jQuery code that goes
        and fetches the next page via AJAX and
        updates the table with the new data.
        The example below assumes that you
        have a web service that returns the new page data.
