            <h2>Welsh Rarebit</h2>

            <p class="intro">Welsh Rarebit is a savory dish made from melted cheese, often
                Cheddar, on toasted bread, and a variety of other ingredients such as mustard,
                egg, or bacon. Here is one take on this classic.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Lightly toast the bread</li>
                <li>Place on a baking tray, and spread with butter.</li>
                <li>Add the grated Cheddar cheese and 2 tablespoons of beer to a saucepan.
                    Place the saucepan over a medium heat, and stir the cheese continuously
                    until it has melted. Add a teaspoon of wholegrain mustard and grind in a
                    little pepper. Keep stirring.
                </li>
                <li>When thick and smooth, pour over each piece of toast spreading it to
                    the edges to stop the toast from burning.
                </li>
                <li>Place under the grill for a couple of minutes or until golden
                    brown.
                </li>
            </ol>
